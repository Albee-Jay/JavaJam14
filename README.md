# JavaJam14
The first website I built - "Java Jam Coffee House"

This is the first website project I built for Gateway Technical College's Full-Stack Web Developer course. I completed the site in October 2020. I had a lot fun learning HTML and CSS while building this website.

See it live here: 

JavaJam14 website does work, but doesn't have the full capabilites it should; being it is only a learning template.

I welcome and appreciate any and all comments or help to make this project better.

Thank You, Albee-Jay
